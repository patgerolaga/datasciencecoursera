# Data Information 
*source URL:* [dataset summary](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

- Dataset exhibits an experiment on wearable computing (using a Samsung Galaxy SII smartphone) carried out to a group of 30 volunteer subjects within an age bracket of 19-48 years old.


# Variables
*source URL:* [dataset variables](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

- Each record in the dataset contains:

  a. Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration

  b. Triaxial angular velocity from the gyroscope

  c. A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables

  d. Activity labels

  e. Identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment


# Data Cleaning/Tidying

- Data cleaning involves:

  1. Merging of training and test datasets

  2. Extraction of means and standard deviations for each measurment
  
  3. Assigning descriptive activity names in the dataset
  
  4. Assigning appropriate labels to variables in the dataset
  
  5. Creating a second, independent tidy data set
